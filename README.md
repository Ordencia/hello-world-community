## Technologies Used
Framework: Django, Language: Python, AWS

Deployed with Heroku

## What I learned
- Leveraged Django framework to build a full-featured web application that allows users to share their experience with software development and post side projects
- Supported user registration, profile update, publishing and editing blog posts
- Created database tables with Django DB models and used Django ORM to query the database and filter through posts
- Implemented pagination for post display pages using Django Paginator to reduce page rendering time as database grows
- Used AWS S3 to host user's profile images after deployment

## Future extensions
I will extend the functionalities to support:

2. upvote system (for sorting)
3. code snippet upload 
4. anonymous comment sections
